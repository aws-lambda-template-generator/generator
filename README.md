# aws-lambda-template-generator

CLI tool for generating AWS Lambda function template.

The project is still very new. We are looking for collaborators who can enrich our lambda template selections. Come to our git repo and contribute to the project!

## Get Started

Install the module globally. It will add the command generate-lambda-template.

```bash
npm i -g aws-lambda-template-generator
```

Then, run the generate-lambda-template command with the name of your project. Default project name is my-lambda if you don't pass the argument.

```bash
generate-lambda-template my-new-lambda-function
```

Follow the prompt.

# What does it create?

It will create a folder with files for whichever lambda function example you choose.
